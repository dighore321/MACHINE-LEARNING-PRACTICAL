1. Implementation of Python Basic Libraries such as Statistics, Math, Numpy and Scipy

a) Usage of methods such as floor(), ceil(), sqrt(), isqrt(), gcd() etc.
b) Usage of attributes of array such as ndim, shape, size, methods such as sum(), mean(), sort(), sin() etc.
c) Usage of methods such as std(), eig() etc.
d) Consider a list datatype(ID) then reshape it into2D, 3D matrix using numpy
e) Generator and omatrices using numpy
f) Find the determinant of a matrix using scipy
g) Find eigen value and eigen vector of a matrix using scipy

2.

a) Write a python program to compute Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation using Datasets
b) Demonstrate various data pre-processing techniques for a given dataset. Write a python program to compute it.
i. Reshaping the data, ii. Filtering the data, iii. Merging the data iv. Handling the missing values in datasets v. Feature Normalization: Min-max normalization

3. Write a Python program to implement Simple Linear Regression and plot the graph.

4. Consider a dataset, use Random Forest to predict the output class. Vary the number of trees as follows and compare the results: 20 ii. 50 iii. 100

5. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm by considering a dataset.

6. Write a Python program to implement K-Means clustering Algorithm. Vary the number of K values as follows and compare the results: i. 1 ii. 3 iii. 5

7. Implement k-nearest neighbors classification using python.

8. Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naÃ¯ve Bayesian Classifier model to perform this task. Built-in Java classes/API can be used to write the program. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set.

9. Write a program to construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease Data Set. You can use Java/Python ML library classes/API.

10. Implement the finite words classification system using Back-propagation algorithm
